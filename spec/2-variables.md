## Task 2.1: Guess the sum
**Task file:** `guess_sum.py`

Have a look at the code, and see if you can work guess what the function will print out!
Then uncomment the print statement, and check if you were right :)

{mysterious number}
```

## Task 2.2: Cone Volume
**Task file:** `cone_volume.py`

You are given two variables 'radius' and 'height' which are radius and height of a cone. Using the formula `( Pi* r^2 *h)/3`, can you find the volume of the cone? 
Print the height, radius and volume, rounded to the nearest whole number.

Hint: Do you remember what data type we use for decimals?

**Expected output:**
```
$ python3 cone_volume.py

Radius of the cone = 3
Height of the cone = 6
56.55
```


## Task 2.3: Ramen, yummmmm!
**Task file:** `ramen_yum.py`

Write a program that determines how many bowls of ramen a restaurant can make from the given sheets of seaweed. A bowl of ramen must have 3 sheets of seaweed, no more, no less!

Your output can look like this:
```
$ python3 ramen_yum.py

How many sheets of seaweed: 7
The number of ramen: 2
```
Hint: Do you remember how to get a whole number while dividing?
