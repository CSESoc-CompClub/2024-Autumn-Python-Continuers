## Setting up
Before we start working, we first need to set up the Python extension on VSCode, so that we can make life easier :)

We first click the little tile button on the left sidebar
![setup1](./spec/images/setup1.png)

Then search up 'python' and install the first option
![setup2](./spec/images/setup2.png)

Yayy we're all ready to roll now!


## Running the Program
You can either click the `Run` button on the top right corner of VSCode like this:

![setup3](./spec/images/setup3.png)

orr you could use the terminal by first `cd`-ing (**c**hanging our **d**irectory -- ie the folder we are working in) and running our file manually
```
$ cd directory-name
$ python3 file_name.py
```
